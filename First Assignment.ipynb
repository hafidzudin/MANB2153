    "    1. Machine learning is a paradigm that may refer to learning from past experience (which in this case is previous data) to improve future performance. The sole focus of this field is automatic learning methods. Learning refers to modification or improvement of algorithm based on past “experiences” automatically without any external assistance from human.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Machine learning studies computer algorithms for learning to do stuff. We might, for instance, be interested in learning to complete a task, or to make accurate predictions, or to behave intelligently. The learning that is being done is always based on some sort of observations or data, such as examples (the most common case in this course), direct experience, or instruction. So in general, machine learning is about learning to do better in the future based on what was experienced in the past. [2]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Machine  learning,  by  its  definition,  is  a  field  of  computer science  that  evolved  from  studying  pattern recognition  and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. It is the learning  and building  of  algorithms  that can  learn  from  and make  predictions  on  data  sets. [3]\n",

    "    3. Optical character recognition: categorize images of handwritten characters by the letters represented [2]\n",
    "    4. Fraud detection: identify credit card transactions (for instance) which may be fraudulent in nature [2]\n",
    "    5. Customer segmentation: predict, for instance, which customers will respond to a particular promotion [2]\n"
